# CF_Python
Analysis of a fictional database from Instacart for the purpose of learning Python coding. This analysis is part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program course requirements. 

## Objective
Instacart stakeholders are interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. The objective of this task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some Instacart data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better targeted marketing. 

## Data
While Instacart is a real company that does make their data available online, the data provided from CareerFoundry has been fabricated for educational purposes. The data used in this task can be found [here.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip)
## Results
My exploratory analysis found that Saturday was the busiest shopping day for Instacart while Wednesday was the least busy. Customers were likely to buy more expensive products at odd hours of the morning (insomnia induced impulse buys?). Items from produce, dairy/eggs, snacks, beverages, and frozen departments were the most frequently ordered among all customers despite differences in demographics and location. I decided to focus on three employment types: student, worker, and retired. Students and retirees, together, made up less than 6% of the customer base but there were some differences in purchasing habits between the three.
